e3=(average-(e1+e2)/3)*3
print("Salary of Third Employee is:",e3)


#4) Write Program - convert a percentage to a fraction (To convert a percentage into fraction let say 30% to a fraction)
per=40
f=40/100
d=100
nume=40/10
deno=100/10
print(int(nume),"/",int(deno))

#5)Write Program - A train 340 m long is running at a speed of 45 km/hr. what time will it take to cross a 160 m long  tunnel?
m=340
tunnel=160
speed=45/36
T=(m+tunnel)/speed
print("\n Time is requied to cross tunnel is:",T,"second")
